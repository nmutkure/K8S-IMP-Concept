****Container Orchestration Enigne (COE)****

The Container Orchestration Engine automates deployment, scaling, and managing containerized applications on a group of services.
Example: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm & Marathon Apache Mesos

Important features of COE

  - Clustering - Master server and worker node to form a cluster of nodes and make it a single computational resource
  - Scheduling - define requirements in the config file and submit them in the orchestration engine  
  - Scalability - Way of increasing and describing application/node instances based on traffic demands  dynamically 
  - Load balancing - Distributes the traffic equally to multiple instances of the application in nodes
  - Fault Tolerance - Monitoring applications running on the worker node and keeps it updating  the Master node, if any nodes 
    go down
    down MAster node automatically creates a new equivalent node
  - Deployment recreate method, rolling update, or canary methods
